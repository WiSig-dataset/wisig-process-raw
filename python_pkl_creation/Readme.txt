This jupyter notebook reads the matlab packet files (.mat) and outputs python pickle files. It ignores small tx-rx pairs based on the number of packets or the size of the file.

It can be applied for both the non-equalized and equalized datasets.

You can use a longer portion of the unprocessed dataset by changing the "slc" variable.
